# Contributing to Knowledge Graph Kit

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're reporting a bug, suggesting a new feature, or submitting a pull request, your input is valuable.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a bug, please open an issue on our GitHub repository. When filing a bug report, please include:

*   A clear and descriptive title.
*   A detailed description of the problem, including steps to reproduce it.
*   The expected behavior and what actually happened.
*   Your environment details (e.g., Python version, OS).

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue to discuss it. This allows us to coordinate our efforts and ensure that the proposed change aligns with the project's goals.

### Submitting Pull Requests

1.  **Fork the repository** and create a new branch from `main`. This creates a personal copy for you to work on without affecting the main project.
2.  **Make your changes** in the new branch.
3.  **Add or update tests** to cover your changes.
4.  **Ensure all tests pass** by running `pytest`.
5.  **Format your code** using a tool like `black` or `ruff format`.
6.  **Submit a pull request** from your fork to the main repository. Provide a clear description of your changes and why they are needed.

We will review your pull request as soon as possible and provide feedback. Thank you for helping us improve the Knowledge Graph Kit!
